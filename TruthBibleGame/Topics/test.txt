2 Abrahams Lesson of sacrificing his son was of a lesson to show him what? #
	The experience God went through in offering His Son to save humanuty #
	That making sacrifice can be difficult #
	That offering humans as sacrifices are acceptable before God #
	That God wants the best offerings #
	PP 154.2 "It was to impress Abraham's mind with the reality of the gospel, as well as to test his faith, that God commanded him to slay his son.  The agony which he endured during the dark days of that fearful trial was permitted that he might understand from his own experience something of the greatness of the sacrifice made by the infinite God for man's redemption. No other test could have caused Abraham such torture of soul as did the offering of his son. God gave His Son to a death of agony and shame." #
